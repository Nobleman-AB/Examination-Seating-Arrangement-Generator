# Examination Seating Arrangement Generator

It takes two files containing information of students (ID) and venues (dimensions) for an examination and generates the seating arrangement as a PDF file which is available for download in the browser upon succesful completion. </br>
The students who must not be placed beside each other (owing to being from a same stream of study), may be separated through an identifier in the student information file.
The output PDF file is formatted as per requirement.
